1. Customize template/hosts.conf (modify details, and change FQDN to your development URL)
2. Place modified hosts.conf in a directory matching the name of your development URL (e.g. dev.something.com)
3. sudo ubuntu-trusted-ca.sh dev.something.com

Notes:
1. Cert + key will be placed in the directory with your hosts.conf
2. This script will only create a cert + key, & register it in the pki db; you must still reference the cert in your httpd config (e.g. apache or nginx)
3. If your browser complains after this script is run, ensure you restarted your http daemon, and quit and restart your browser
